    <h2>üöÄ About Me</h2>
<!--     <p><img src="termina-gh.gif" alt="Terminal GH GIF" /></p> -->
    <p>I'm an Iowa-licensed attorney with expertise in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. I developed this expertise starting in law school with my thesis "Freedom From Fiat" about crypto and international monetary policy, followed by getting involved in LexDAO in 2019, then serving as a Protocol Specialist with Figment for 2.5 years, where I was exposed to and developed a strong understanding of dozens of crypto protocols. I later served as Protocol Counsel at a decentralized Ai startup leveraging blockchain technology to secure computing power. I currently provide expert witness consulting as a Certified Cryptocurrency Forensic Investigator (CCFI) through my company Blockchain Expert Consulting.</p>
