    <h2>üöÄ About Me</h2>

<p>I am an Iowa-licensed attorney with expertise in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. I started developing this expertise in law school when I wrote my thesis Freedom From Fiat about crypto and international monetary rights. I later got involved in LexDAO in 2019 (Member of OC 2023-24), then served as a Protocol Specialist with Figment for 2.5 years where I developed a strong understanding of dozens of crypto protocols and blockchain governance. I later served as Protocol Counsel at a decentralized Ai startup called Ai Layer Labs, which is developing a blockchain protocol to secure decentralized computing power. I currently provide expert witness consulting to legal disputes where digital assets or blockchain technology is involved. I serve in this role as a McAfee Institute Certified Cryptocurrency Forensic Investigator (CCFI) through my company Blockchain Expert Consulting Inc.</p>
